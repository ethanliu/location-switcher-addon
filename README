Location Switcher is a navigation help tool for web develoeprs.  It allows you to easily switching between sites, i.e. Swtiching between "localhost" and "example.com" just by one click.

"Loop" option is on by default and fits most cases, it means you can switch from "source" to "target" and from "target" to "source".

Disable "loop" to make a one way only route or create your own loop, i.e. a -> b, b -> c, c -> a, etc.
