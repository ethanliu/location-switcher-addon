http://localhost <-> http://example.com
http://dev1.local -> http://localhost
http://dev2.local -> http://localhost

or create your custom loop

http://project.local -> http://test1.server
http://test1.server -> http://test2.server
http://test2.server -> http://live.server
http://live.server -> http://project.local
